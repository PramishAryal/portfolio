                Hello there. My name is Pramish Aryal. I am a 18 year old college freshman studying Computer Engineering
                and I aim to be a game developer.
                And I know what you're thinking, why would a guy who wants to be a game dev study computer engineering
                instead of getting a proper Computer Science degree or even study on his own. Well, the answer to that
                my friend is, <B>Scholarship</B>. It's actually really hard to find a proper uni that'll get me a noice
                CS degree from where I am. Either they offer no direct CS degree, or, they will ask for a lot of money.
                And a lot of money is something I do not have. Simply put, I'm broke :( . So I did what any sensible man
                would do, got a scholarship to study computer engineering, and throughout my college life, I'll learn to
                make games and maybe just maybe I'll actually create one. So stay tuned my dudes. Enough about that, not
                onto the good stuff. To describe myself in a single word, I AM LAZY. And hence, I spend most of my days
                watching anime, movies, tv shows and playing games instead of doing something productive.
                Some of my favourite anime and tv series include:
