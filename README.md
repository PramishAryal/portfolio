# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is my first attempt at building my portfolio, though I don't have any projects to show off.
The nav bar fulfills the bootstrap grid criteria
index.html contains well the basic entry point of my website
about_me.html contains info about me and is supposed to have full filled the criteria of a table and an unordered list as well as the images
projects.html will contain info about my projects which are non-existent currently
contact.html contains methods to contact me

basically all the requirements for the project have been done in the about_me page
